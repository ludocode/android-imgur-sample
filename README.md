This is a sample Android app that displays content from Imgur. It demonstrates:

- Performing JSON and JPEG/PNG web requests asynchronously
- Fetching a paginated gallery from the Imgur API
- Showing thumbnails in a staggered grid with deferred image loading
- Continuous scrolling of a very large list using a RecyclerView
- Safe handling of failed connections and JSON parsing errors
- Use of a Navigation Drawer overlay on top of the activity
- Correct clearing and reloading of data from the same or different galleries
- Material Design elements including FloatingActionButton and CardView with drop shadow
- Launching an external app via an Intent
- Android Studio and Gradle
